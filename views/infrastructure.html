            <p>
                Blockchain reinforces infrastructure by offering decentralized, tamper-proof systems that ensure 
                security and reliability. Here's how it benefits:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Resilience:</strong> Decentralized systems reduce the risk of downtime and cyber-attacks.</li>
                <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Blockchain streamlines operations, ensuring faster processing and minimal delays.</li>
                <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Handles large volumes of data and users efficiently.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                By integrating blockchain, E-Vote enhances its infrastructure to support secure, reliable, and efficient voting systems.
